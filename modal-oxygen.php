        <h4 class="text-center">Are you buying an oxygen concentrator for someone with COVID?</h4><br />
        <p class="lead text-info">Please amplify this crowdsourced info— it's verified. You could save a life!
        </p>
        <p class="text-warning">Note: this is about O2 concentrators NOT cylinders.</p>
        </p>
        <p>1. Ensure the concentrator has <b>high flow rate</b>. 10L is great.
          <br /><br />
          2. Buy the <b>'90%±3%' concentration output</b>, NOT '30-90±3%'. Very very important.
          <br /><br />
          3. Do NOT buy Dedakj (not for COVID!) & Philips 3ltr (pretty useless). <b>Go for Airsep or Philips 5L — both
            work.</b>
          <br /><br />
          4. Certification matters.
          <br /><br />
          5. Concentrator <b>shouldn't be less than 15kg</b>–lightweight ones can't provide oxygen at the required flow
          rate
          for those with high dependency on oxygen.
          <br /><br />
          6. If you're using US oxygen concentrators, they're only 110V. <b>You will need a transformer to step it up to
            230V.</b>
          <br /><br />
          7. <b>Please please watch out for this: sellers can try to fool you with high prices by highlighting '5 ltr',
            '8
            ltr', '10 ltr' flow rates</b>. THIS IS NOT ENOUGH. Ensure output of 90%(±3%) concentration of oxygen. This
          high
          percentage really is the need of the hour.
          <br /><br />
          8. Lastly, <b>concentrators that do not fulfil these conditions are less ideal for Covid cases</b>. But, if
          there is
          no other option, other concentrators can still save lives by providing patients the necessary relief — so
          please purchase them if all else fails.
          <br /><br />
          9. Final note on prices; this is important: <b>Do NOT assume that more expensive means better quality</b>.
          Many cheap
          concentrators can be good and expensive ones can be rubbish. Refer to all the above notes and ensure they are
          met. Concentrators usually cost between Rs. 40K-90K.<br /><br />
